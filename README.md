# OOPS-PROGRAM
Aim: To implement various control statements in Java (if-else, if-else-if, switch-case, for loop, while loop) for solving real-life logical problems and to enhance algorithmic thinking through structured program flow.

The system randomly selects a number between 1 to 100.
The user keeps guessing until they get it right. After each guess, display:
“Too High”
“Too Low”
“Correct Guess!”

Develop a program that implements this guessing game.
